The following is the explanation to the C++ code to play a video in C++ using the tool OpenCV.
Things to know:
(1) The code will only compile in Linux environment.
(2) To run in windows, please use the file: ‘play_video.o’ and run it in cmd. However if it does not run(problem in system architecture) then compile it in
windows by making suitable and obvious changes to the code like: Use
<iostream.h> in place of <iostream>.
(3) Compile command: g++ -w vid.cpp -o vid `pkg-config –libs opencv`
(4) Run command: ./vid
(5) Please make sure that the video : “Bumpy.mp4” is in the same location.
Before you run the code, please make sure that you have OpenCV installed on your system.
Code Snippet: as above
